== About lib-dta-ch ==

lib-dta-ch is a PHP library to record bank transactions electronically,
and to prepare these transactions for automatic processing by Swiss
banks with the help of an standardized DTA record file. DTA is the
abbreviation for 'Datentr√§geraustauschverfahren', and describes methods
to exchange data media between financial institutes, and its clients.

This library provides classes and methods to record both single and
multiple transactions, to validate, cumulate, and sort these records
according to the DTA specification from <<SIX, SIX Interbank Clearing>>.
